# Handwash-Monitoring
A hand wash monitoring system to help maintain proper hygiene.

## Project Summary
Practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infections. Hospital staff tends to perform hand hygiene properly often only when they are aware that they are being observed. To track compliance, we aim to design a simple, cost-effective solution easily reproducible on a mass scale which will in real time, monitor the entire process of hand washing.

>The World Health Organisation provides an [8 step process](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Hand_Hygiene_Why_How_and_When_Brochure.pdf) of washing hands properly to maintain hygiene.


Our product ensures that the person washing their hands follows these steps properly for the designated amount of time. **The
set-up will monitor hand movements and provide feedback to the user on what steps they need to follow.**
